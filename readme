# Posture Monitoring System

A real-time, browser-based posture analysis tool powered by **TensorFlow.js** and a lightweight **Node.js** backend. Designed to promote ergonomic wellness and help users maintain proper posture during long desk sessions.

## Overview

Modern work habits often involve long hours in front of screens, leading to slouched backs, forward head posture, and chronic discomfort. This project provides an on-device posture monitoring assistant that evaluates posture using the webcam and offers gentle alerts when alignment deteriorates.

The system performs pose estimation fully in the browser to ensure privacy, while a small Node.js backend manages event signaling and alert logic.

## Problem Statement

Extended periods of poor posture can cause:

* Neck and back pain
* Reduced productivity
* Muscular imbalance
* Long-term spinal issues

Users often fail to correct posture consistently without external feedback. A continuous, real-time, non-intrusive monitoring tool can significantly improve posture awareness and reduce strain.

---

## Approach & Solution

The posture monitoring workflow is based on computer vision and pose estimation:

1. The webcam feed is accessed using `getUserMedia()`.
2. TensorFlow.js pose detection models analyze key body landmarks (MoveNet or BlazePose).
3. Alignment metrics are calculated:

   * Forward head displacement
   * Shoulder rounding
   * Torso tilt and symmetry
4. A real-time posture score represents posture quality.
5. The backend (Node.js + Socket.IO) pushes posture alerts when thresholds are crossed.
6. The UI shows visual overlays, posture metrics, and alerts in real time.

This design keeps inference on-device (privacy-first) and uses the backend only for real-time signaling and optional analytics.

## Setup & Installation

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
# create .env if needed (PORT, SOCKET_PATH, etc.)
node server.js    # or `nodemon server.js`
```

**Example `server.js` responsibilities**

* Serve socket namespace for posture alerts
* Accept connections from browser clients
* Optionally store event logs or forward to analytics service

### Frontend

Open `index.html` using a static server or Live Server extension.

```bash
cd frontend
npx http-server    # serve the frontend on a local port
```

**Notes**

* The frontend uses TensorFlow.js to run MoveNet/BlazePose in-browser.
* Make sure the frontend connects to the backend Socket.IO URL (e.g. `http://localhost:3000`).

## Posture Scoring & Alert Logic (example)

* **Forward Head Tilt**: `warning` if > 15°, `urgent` if > 20°.
* **Torso Tilt**: `warning` if > 12°, `urgent` if > 18°.
* **Shoulder Asymmetry**: `warning` if asymmetry > 0.05 of frame height.
* **Sustained durations**:

  * Warning sustained: >= 15 seconds
  * Urgent sustained: >= 10 seconds

The backend emits `warning` or `urgent` events to the UI when these thresholds are crossed for the sustained durations.
